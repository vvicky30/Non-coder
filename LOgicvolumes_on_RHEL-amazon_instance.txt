found name of s/w that give command pvcreate:

 Free  PE / Size       1022 / 3.99 GiB -----common space(make as many partition)
Minimum size of partition = 512 byte = 1 sector   [In real HD]
here, min size of partition = 4MB = 1 sector [In virtual HD] 
 PE Size               4.00 MiB  =====we can change this
If we'll give 2 mb it will be 4mb, if 7 then it will become 8mb(in multiple of 4)

# lvcreate --name part1  --size 400M  myvirhdd
logical volume =lv,  name of partition, size of partition 
How os will know HD is real or virtual?
Hd info is stored in /dev
/dev/par1 ==No bcz part1 is partition not HDD
/dev/myvirhdd/part1

# lvdisplay  --- If you do not remember than command to know
  --- Logical volume ---

Device mapper also create a name for itself and we can use any of them
Disk /dev/mapper/myvirhdd-part1: 419 MB, 419430400 bytes, 819200 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
