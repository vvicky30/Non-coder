nfs    network file system [for sharing directories with other clients ]so we can't tell which
port it is using and aws has a firewall before entering to os[we don't know port how we'll
tell aw
nfs do problem with aws


nfs don't work with single port and single service
nfs pick port randomly for some services 
works on unix
$ssh ec2-user@IPoftarget -i adhocnv.pem
#yum install bash-completion
tab completion is given by bash-completion [command double tab -get options]
#bash 
#yum install nfs-utils -y
#systemctl status nfs    
We'll start the service of nfs by systemctl
#systemctl start nfs-server
#systemctl enable nfs-server.service
OR
#systemctl enable nfs-server
#mkdir /nfs
#whereis /*nfs  -----to see where is cong file
[making directory in / so that we don't have to provide path access]
To export directory : use exports

#rpm -q nfs-utils
#rpm -qc nfs-utils                -----to see where is cong file

# vi /etc/nfs.conf
:q



/nfs	IPofclient
but if we don't know the ip of client
/nfs         *(filesystem)

filesystem = READONLY --(ro)
	     READWRITE

vi /etc/exports
.......................................
/nfs	*(ro)
:wq
.......................................

damon do entry using systemctl
To update the changes in export file do
#exportfs -r
securitygroup>addrule ------------- we don't know which port nfs will use
customtcp = All traffic
TCP = All
Anywhere
save
#showmount -e public-IP of our os
what the server has shared
o/p /nfs*        [if you have given the IP then Ip will be shown]
......................................................................................till here of server side
Client side:


Make a client instance with which you want to share your directory
$ssh -i adhocnv.pem ec2-user@IPofserver
yes
#yum install nfs-utils
[So that we can use nfs file system]
client shouls also have nfs-utils
No need of starting any service at client side
#yum install bash-completion
#bash
#showmount -e privateIPofserver
If error come than try:
#iptables -F
#systemctl restart nfs

If we keep Ip same -- we are both Server and client than o/p will come definetly

#showmount -e IP
We have to mount this directory
#mkdir /mnt/nfs -----------we are mounting at this location
#mount 172.31.45.242:/nfs /mnt/nfs/
IP of server
#df -hT ------to show the mount files
server is serving nfs
#cd /mnt/nfs
#ls
#mkdir tt
ERROR : READONLY
but server can create
To make changes persistent:
vi /etc/fstab
IPofServer:/nfs /mnt/nfs   nfs  _netdev 0 0
:wq
# default: whether or not get IP it will mount [for device]
# netdev: when IP is to be found over the network
#mount -a
#df

..............................................................................................
Server side: But server can create 
And client can see the changed content
#cd /nfs
#mkdir lk
#touch a.txt
#vi a.txt
.....................................................................................
#ls
a.txt
cat a.txt ---------------------------- client can see the updated changes in directory shared by 
the server
++++++++++If the client has write priviledge then client can write data as much as the
size of server, if size of server gets full client cannot write more data in directory+++
Directory get its size from /
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Working with read-write permissions of nfs:
Server Side:
We have make link between two OS for sharing data
#ls -ld /nfs
The user[may be root of its own system] which come to server bringing a 
task is a nfs-nobody for server
The user is other for server [and if we give all permission to other than all can modify
this is a drawback]
#chmod 757 /nfs/ -------------giving permission to other
#exportfs -r
#ls -ld /nfs
bcz of others permission other user can also access we don't want that so
#chmod 755 /nfs/ ------------so that other than client nobody can make changes

vi /etc/exports
/nfs  *(rw,no_root_squash)
:wq

OR
/nfs  IPofClient(rw,no_root_squash)
:wq
#exportfs -r
#ls -ld /nfs
no_root_squash : to give root power to the client so that it can work
.....................................................
Client side:

#mkdir ll      now client can update
#ls -ld /nfs
o/p root root ----------------------------no_root_sqash work with root power

If we don't make changes permanent than it will be unmount on reboot
To make changes permanent: [entry on client side
# vi /etc/fstab
172.31.45.242:/nfs /mnt/nfs/   nfs	_netdev 0 0
:wq
172.31.45.242-server ip
#umount /mnt/nfs/
Error will come if you r inside that directory
#cd ..
#umount mnt/nfs/
#mount -a --------------- to check entry are done correct [always do before reboot]
#df -hT
netdev -- telling that system should not mount when it is getting up bcz at that time it will 
not be having the ip , it will get ip through network so mount at last

Task: Make partition and share with client
We can also share existing directory

..........................................................................................................
NTFS XFS --- can mount disk on the system on which they are attached

NFS --- we can mount over the n/w where that drive is not present

movies on disk : share it over n/w
all can play it using their media player

GFS = Google file system
